Bubs wants you to track information on his customers (first name, last name, email),
 his employees (first name, last name, start date, position held), his products, and the purchases 
 customers make (which customer, when it was purchased, for how much money). Think about how many 
tables you should create. Which data goes in which tables? How should the tables relate to one another?

Include things like primary keys and foreign keys, and anything else you think you should have in the
 tables. Make sure to use reasonable data types for each column.
